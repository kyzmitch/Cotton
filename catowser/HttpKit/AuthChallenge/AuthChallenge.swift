 The DNS name in the certificate might be a wildcard name, for example, "*.apple.com".
 but `host` parameter could be specific address like "m.apple.com"
 so that, it's required to convert it to wildcard name before check

 If server trust evaluation fails because the server's DNS name does not match the DNS name in the certificate,
 you can work around the failure by overriding the DNS name in the trust object.
 To do this, call SecPolicyCreateSSL to create a new policy object with the correct server name
 and then call SecTrustSetPolicies to apply it to the trust object.

 Typically you would expect to find this DNS name in the subject's Common Name field,
 but it can also be in a Subject Alternative Name extension. If a name is present in
 the Subject Alternative Name extension, it takes priority over the Common Name.

 TLS server certificates must present the DNS name of the server in the Subject Alternative Name extension
 of the certificate. DNS names in the CommonName of a certificate are no longer trusted.
