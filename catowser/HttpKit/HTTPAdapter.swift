/// Interface for some HTTP networking library (e.g. Alamofire or URLSession) to hide it and
/// not use it directly and be able to mock it for unit testing.
/// Also, it allows to use completely different callback APIs (closure, Reactive observers, Combine promises, etc.
/// It seems it should be only implemented by classes (see AnyObject requirement),
/// because network library API probably uses closures and should be able to access `self`
/// and should be avoid copying closures, original closure should be used
